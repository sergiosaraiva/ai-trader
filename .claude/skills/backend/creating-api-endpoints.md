# Creating API Endpoints (DEPRECATED)

**This skill has been merged into [creating-fastapi-endpoints](./SKILL.md).**

## Redirect

All FastAPI endpoint patterns are now documented in:
- **Skill**: `creating-fastapi-endpoints`
- **Location**: `.claude/skills/backend/SKILL.md`

The consolidated skill includes:
- Router setup and app integration
- GET/POST endpoint patterns
- Pydantic request/response models
- Pagination with Query parameters
- Service availability checks
- Error handling patterns
- Database session injection

## Migration

If you were using `creating-api-endpoints`, use `creating-fastapi-endpoints` instead.

The skill-router has been updated to route API endpoint tasks to the consolidated skill.
