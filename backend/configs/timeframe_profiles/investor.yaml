  # Medium-Term Model Configuration
  # Purpose: Position management and rebalancing signals
  # Rationale: Weekly is standard for institutional position management.
  #            Captures weekly cycles and options expiration effects.
  #            7x factor from Daily. Weekly MACD/RSI highly reliable.

  # Long-Term Model Configuration
  # Purpose: Strategic allocation and market regime detection
  # Rationale: Monthly has highest signal reliability for regime detection.
  #            Best for identifying bull/bear phases. Limited data (12/year)
  #            requires 3+ years historical data for meaningful training.
