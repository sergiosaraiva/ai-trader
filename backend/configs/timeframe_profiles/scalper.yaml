# Scalper Timeframe Profile
# =========================
# Optimized for very short-term, almost real-time trading
# Target users: Scalpers, high-frequency day traders, algorithmic traders
#
# Timeframe Selection Rationale:
# - Follows the Factor of 4 Rule: 15m → 1H (4x) → 4H (4x)
# - 15m: Fastest practical timeframe for ML models (~65% noise)
# - 1H: Context for intraday trend direction
# - 4H: Major intraday support/resistance levels
#
# WARNING: Lower timeframes have higher noise and require:
# - More data for training
# - Tighter risk management
# - Lower latency execution
# - Higher transaction frequency (more fees)

  # Short-Term Model Configuration
  # Purpose: Fast entry/exit signals for scalping
  # Rationale: 15m is the fastest practical timeframe for ML models.
  #            Below 15m, noise dominates (>70%) making ML unreliable.
  #            Captures micro-trends and quick reversals.

  # Medium-Term Model Configuration
  # Purpose: Intraday trend direction and bias
  # Rationale: 1H provides cleaner signals for trend context.
  #            4x factor from 15m. Standard for intraday trading.

  # Long-Term Model Configuration
  # Purpose: Major intraday levels and session context

  #            4x factor from 1H. Provides broader context for scalping.

  # Important considerations for scalping
  considerations:
    - "Higher noise level requires more conservative position sizing"
    - "Transaction costs significantly impact profitability"
    - "Requires low-latency execution infrastructure"
    - "More prone to false signals - use strict stop losses"
    - "Best during high-liquidity sessions (London/NY overlap)"
    - "Avoid during major news events"
