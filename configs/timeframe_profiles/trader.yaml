# Optimized for active trading with faster decision cycles
# Target users: Day traders, swing traders, active position traders
#
# Timeframe Selection Rationale:
# - Follows the Factor of 4-6 Rule: 1H → 4H (4x) → 1D (6x)
# - 1H: Optimal signal-to-noise for ML-based intraday prediction
# - 4H: Industry standard for swing trading, filters intraday noise
# - 1D: Gold standard for position trading, where indicators were designed
